About/Help Button 
-----------------

On the top left margin, the BRS Translator has an "About/Help" button that will toggle a display that contains three essential references.

Link to Help Guide
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A link to this documentation.

Link to Elasticsearch Regex Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A link to the Elasticsearch Regex Rules which provides an overview of the syntax for understanding the Elasticsearch version of regular expressions (i.e., Elasticsearch does not adopt all of Perl Compatible Regular Expressions).  


.. note:: Elasticsearch Regex Rules link does not provide any guidance on how to utilize the fields that new Search application will utilize.


Field Reference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Field Reference displays a table of the new Search application fields, including the field syntax, the full name of the field, and an example of the syntax appropriate for that field.  These are just the fields that the BRS Translator will produce in the Regex Pattern Output, and does not include the entire list that the new Search application will utilize.

RegexRef Button
---------------

On the top right margin, the BRS Translator has an "RegexRef" button that will toggle a display that contains regular expression syntax references that may be displayed by the BRS Translator in the Regex Pattern Output.

The Regex Reference Has Two Modes and Three Display Filters

Basic/Advanced Modes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Basic** - This is the default Setting and will display only the essential Regex syntax for equivalence with X-Search's BRS syntax.  This mode is the analagoue to the "Accurate" Regex Output Display and can be used to review the "Accurate" results.

**Advanced** - This setting provides a more comprehensive list of Regex syntax that can be used for pattern matching in the new Search application.  This mode is the analogue to the "Broader" Regex Output Display and can be used to review the "Broader" results.

**Filters** - The three filters can be toggled on and off to modify the display of information in the Reference and are all set to on by default.  The filter groups represent the three main types of syntax - Quantifiers, Grouping, and Wildcards.

  **Quantifiers** - Syntax that indicates how many instances of a specific pattern argument to match.  The pattern argument syntax is always first, and is followed by a quantifier (if a quantifier exists). 

  The pattern arument/quantifier set always occurs like this: **[Pattern Argument][Quantifier]**.  For example, the pattern argument/quantifier set **a{1,3}** has **a** as the pattern argument and **{1,3}** as the quantifier - this set will pattern match 1 to 3 instances of the letter "a".   
  
  Where no quantifier exists, the argument is a single instance.  For example, the pattern argument **a** without a quantifier will pattern match exactly one instance of the letter "a".
  
  **Grouping** - Syntax that defines a pattern argument.  The grouping syntax can indicate to match one of a set of characters, to not match one of a set of characters, or match a sequence of characters.  Grouping syntax can also be used to make more complex pattern arguments that consist of several nested arguments.
  
  **Wildcards** - Syntax that defines a pattern argument to match any character other than a space.  Wildcards work just like any other pattern argument in that you can create a pattern argument/quantifier set to designate the amount of instances of the argument you would like to match, or it will match exactly one if no quantifier exists.  In Elasticsearch syntax there is only one wildcard character, the period (or dot as it is commonly refered), **(.)**.  When the dot is used with a quantifier it can emulate all of the X-Search wildcards.
