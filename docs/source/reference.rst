Link to Help Guide
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A link to this documentation.

Link to Elasticsearch Reference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A link to the Elasticsearch Reference which provides an overview of the syntax for understanding the Elasticsearch version of regular expressions (i.e., Elasticsearch does not adopt all of Perl Compatible Regular Expressions).  

NOTE: Elasticsearch Reference does not provide any guidance on how to utilize the fields that new Search application will utilize.

Field Reference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Field Reference displays a table of the new Search application fields, including the field syntax, the full name of the field, and an example of the syntax appropriate for that field.  These are just the fields that the BRS Translator will produce in the Regex Pattern Output, and does not include the entire list that the new Search application will utilize.

.. _RegexRef:

RegexRef Button
---------------


.. image:: ../_static/BRS-RegexRefButton.png

On the top right margin, the BRS Translator has an "RegexRef" button that will toggle a display that contains regular expression syntax references that may be displayed by the BRS Translator in the Regex Pattern Output.

The Regex Reference Has Two Modes and Three Display Filters

Basic/Advanced Modes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Basic - This is the default Setting and will display only the essential Regex syntax for equivalence with X-Search's BRS syntax.  This mode is the analagoue to the "Accurate" Regex Output Display and can be used to review the "Accurate" results.

.. image:: ../_static/BRS-RegexRefBasic.png

Advanced - This setting provides a more comprehensive list of Regex syntax that can be used for pattern matching in the new Search application.  This mode is the analogue to the "Broader" Regex Output Display and can be used to review the "Broader" results.

Filters - The three filters can be toggled on and off to modify the display of information in the Reference and are all set to on by default.  The filter groups represent the three main types of syntax - Quantifiers, Grouping, and Wildcards.

  Quantifiers
  
  Grouping
  
  Wildcards
